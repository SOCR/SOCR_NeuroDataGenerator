** Note: To prevent extreme costs and unstainable OpenAI API fees, the current default options of the AI Bot rely on lower-quality generative-AI models. If you are interested in using the latest, greatest, and most expensive models, you need to provide your own OpenAI API  Key (specify your API Key in the “Setting”).
